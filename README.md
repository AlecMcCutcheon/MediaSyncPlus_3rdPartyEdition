# MediaSync Plus: 3rd Party Edition
Built upon the excellent foundation of MediaSync Lite, MediaSync Plus is a Standalone Version with Additional features like:

  - Skips duplicate songs in your library.
  - A new Lights Out theme.
  - Can run locally as a single HTML file.
  - Automatic authentication token caching
  - Improved, refactored Logic.
  - Expect more updates in the future.

Please note that when you upload files using web browsers, it don't share the complete file path for security reasons. However, when you use standalone programs or scripts to upload music to Ibroadcast, these tools do include the full file path for added functionality. This enables Ibroadcast to carry out specific tasks, like automatically identifying album, artist, title, and album artist information for tracks that might be missing this information. Additionally, it helps us avoid uploading the same files again when we edit file details and then re-upload because Ibroadcast checks for identical file paths. So even though this may be an improvement from MediaSync Lite it is still recommended you use one of the standalone desktop uploaders or scripts
